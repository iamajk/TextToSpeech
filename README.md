# Text-to-Speech (TTS) Widget

## Overview
This repository provides a simple yet powerful **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Widget** that can be embedded into any webpage. It allows users to convert on-screen text into speech using the Web Speech API.

## Features
- üîä **Speak Any Text**: Reads the selected text or the full webpage content aloud.
- üéô **Voice Selection**: Choose from multiple available voices.
- ‚ö° **Adjustable Speed & Pitch**: Customize the speech rate and pitch for a better listening experience.
- ‚è∏ **Pause, Resume, Stop**: Full control over speech playback.
- üìå **Click-to-Speak**: Click on any part of the page to start reading from there.
- üé® **Lightweight & Customizable**: Simple CSS styling and minimal dependencies.

## Installation
### 1. Add the Required Files
Include the following files in your project directory:
- `tts-widget.js` (JavaScript logic for TTS)

### 2. Link the Widget in Your HTML File
Add these lines in your HTML file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="tts-widget.css">
<script src="tts-widget.js" defer></script>
